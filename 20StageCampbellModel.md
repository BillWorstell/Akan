# The 20-Stage Campbell Model: A Framework for Persuasion and Action

## Overview
This model divides the Hero’s Journey into **two cycles**:
1. **Persuasion: Moving Minds** (Stages 1–10) – Focuses on processing inputs from the environment to update mental models and achieve a new understanding.
2. **Action: Moving Hearts** (Stages 11–20) – Focuses on forming intentions, executing actions, and comparing results to expectations.

Each cycle includes **five pairs of concrete and abstract stages**, balancing tangible and intangible elements of transformation.

## Part 1: Moving Minds – Processing Inputs for New Understanding

### Stage 1: Concrete Input (Reading, Listening)

- **Goal**: Collect specific, observable information.

### Stage 2: Abstract Input (Imagined or Modeled)
- **Description**: The hero contemplates the implications of the input, imagining or modeling possibilities.
- **Example**: Bilbo Baggins hesitating to leave his comfortable hobbit hole in *The Hobbit*.
- **Goal**: Reflect internally on fears or doubts about the journey.

### Stage 3: Concrete Adjustment
- **Description**: The hero receives external assistance, adjusting to new tools or guidance.
- **Example**: Harry Potter receiving his wand from Hagrid.
- **Goal**: Incorporate actionable external resources.

### Stage 4: Abstract Adjustment
- **Description**: The hero mentally commits to integrating the input, symbolically crossing into a new world.
- **Example**: Neo taking the red pill in *The Matrix*.
- **Goal**: Adjust internal perspective and prepare for transformation.

### Stage 5: Concrete Variation
- **Description**: The hero encounters tangible trials, testing adaptability.
- **Example**: Hercules completing the 12 Labors.

- **Example**: Buddha meditating under the Bodhi tree.
- **Goal**: Formulate generalized principles from new perspectives.

### Stage 9: Concrete Reconciliation
- **Description**: The hero reconciles specific elements of the new understanding with their previous worldview.
- **Example**: Luke Skywalker confronting Darth Vader in *Star Wars*.
- **Goal**: Integrate new insights into a cohesive framework.

### Stage 10: Abstract Reconciliation
